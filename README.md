# objectdetectioniot
This project is an end-to-end computer vision and IoT system designed to perform real-time object detection and counting using YOLOv8. The system integrates ESP32-based edge devices with a Python AI server via TCP/MQTT communication and logs detection results to Excel and cloud dashboards.
